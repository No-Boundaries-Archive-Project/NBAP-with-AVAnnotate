It's become very difficult, in the present moment, to cleanly name, because we are getting inspiration from this globalized identity. This effects, deeply, how young people think about themselves and identify, because now, whether I know an artist or not, I can see what Nelisiwe is doing in South Africa, or what Danais doing in Quebec, what Gerard is doing in London.
