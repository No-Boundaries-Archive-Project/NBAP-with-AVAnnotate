So continuing this thing, it goes to Miami, it becomes Black Male Revisited, Songs for the Dark Divine. I know I'm being curated as a part of a music series, so there is this idea of musicality and emotionality and all of this stuff that I'm thinking about. I'm thinking about surveillance and optics and how do people look at me and how do I look at them. What is a song, what is a song for the Dark Divine? Understanding how Philly can be super segregated, just all of these things play a part in the way I go into a venue and what I present. I rarely, if ever, am able to present the same thing twice. I don't know how to do that, because for me, live performance, it's living. And so, I feel like I have to honor the fact that this is a living thing. So I have to make sure that I've created each experience is of itself. There's something very unique about each moment, each presentation, that's different from what it was and what it will be. And so I think even for Unwrap and No Boundaries to be situated in Colorado, we're aware that we're pushing up against so much history, so much complexities around viewership of Black and Brown people, the consumption of those bodies."

You will be able to fully participate or participate more fully in your humanity because these questions are being asked now of the present moment. You will be able to disrupt in whichever you choose or need to disrupt because these previous disruptions and interruptions have taken place.

It's twofold, because, of course, I know that this thing is existing with a lot of stereotypes, a lot of constructs, a lot of preordained prescriptions. So that's a given. But also, there is this rich complexity of experience and vitality and struggle that has lead forth to what we see displayed on the stage.

I've thought about this, but I'm like, \"Oh, of course.\" Like, we can live in our joy and our struggle. Like, the two are not going to be separated.
