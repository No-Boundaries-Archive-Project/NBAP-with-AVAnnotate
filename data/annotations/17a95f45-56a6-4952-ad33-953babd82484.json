So continuing this thing, it goes to Miami, it becomes Black Male Revisited, Songs for the Dark Divine. I know I'm being curated as a part of a music series, so there is this idea of musicality and emotionality and all of this stuff that I'm thinking about. I'm thinking about surveillance and optics and how do people look at me and how do I look at them. What is a song, what is a song for the Dark Divine? Understanding how Philly can be super segregated, just all of these things play a part in the way I go into a venue and what I present. I rarely, if ever, am able to present the same thing twice. I don't know how to do that, because for me, live performance, it's living. And so, I feel like I have to honor the fact that this is a living thing. So I have to make sure that I've created each experience is of itself. There's something very unique about each moment, each presentation, that's different from what it was and what it will be. And so I think even for Unwrap and No Boundaries to be situated in Colorado, we're aware that we're pushing up against so much history, so much complexities around viewership of Black and Brown people, the consumption of those bodies."

Is in conversation with, What is Canadian? That's in conversation with, what is Caribbean? That's in conversation with what is African, and what is European and Asian? It's become very difficult, in the present moment, to cleanly name, because we are getting inspiration from this globalized identity. This effects, deeply, how young people think about themselves and identify, because now, whether I know an artist or not, I can see what Nelisiwe is doing in South Africa, or what Danais doing in Quebec, what Gerard is doing in London. All of that is part of my African American juice now."
