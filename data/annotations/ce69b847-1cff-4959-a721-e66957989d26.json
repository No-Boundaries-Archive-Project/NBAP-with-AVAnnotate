This idea of legacy it's like I'm getting this work from you. You're passing this work onto people. I'm actually going to set the last solo that I actually originally did in 2000 on a dancer who used to work with me 15 years ago. She was recently named one of the top 25 in Dance Magazine. She's having her own career and she danced with David Dorfman and did some work with Urban Bush Women and Liz Lerman. Now she has her own career so I'm going to set that on her. I'm going to read the poem, which I've never gotten to read. She'll do the work and that's the last piece in the show. In between each of these is, like I said, some footage. Different timing, so you don't get bored of, \"Oh, here's the video moment.\" Sometimes I just do a piece without and then you'll see the video afterwards. Backstage changing is pretty fun. It's like, \"Get this on her head, quick! Put that on.\""

It's artists who help us have these conversations. When I first started learning this there was this conversation also about black dance. That wasn't a term, that wasn't a label, that the choreographers gave themselves. That was something that the white critics, who hadn't seen anything like that, that wasn't being put on stage. There was something about the works of these African American artists that they were speaking too, but they said black dance, which then lumped a whole group of folks together."

The No Less Black solo actually started as a poem that I was writing. Not for people to hear, but I wrote it and then I made a dance to it. Then I made an evening length work to it. That was the first big thing I made. Then I just kept making things. I still think I'm a dancer. Now I'm a professor. I wasn't like, \"I'm going to be a professor at the university.\" I just kept following that curiosity. The next thing you know I'm a professor at a university. Hilarious. It's not hilarious. It's awesome, but it wasn't in the plan. All the things that I learned when I was studying, when I was taking my ballet classes and my modern classes and then African classes and then dancing in the clubs all of that stuff ends up being in the work. Again, you're talking about your real life. This was my communities. This was things that I'm curious about. Sometimes there's not a [tan-dews 01:07:43] but I needed my [tan-dews 01:07:47]. I was in Ralph Lemon's work. I don't know if you all are familiar with him. He just won a national metal of honor for his artistry. You get that from the president, so he got it from Barack Obama. Really, experimental and he tried to make an un-dance, like take away all of the form, and it's like I still needed my dance training to do what I did. People will be like, \"You don't need to dance to know how to do that.\" \"Well, you do it.\" All the stuff that I thought ... the education comes from everywhere.
